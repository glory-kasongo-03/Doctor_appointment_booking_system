| **Template**         | **Columns and Workflows**                           | **Automation Features**                                              | **Suitability for Agile Methodologies**                                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kanban**           | To Do, In Progress, Done                           | Auto-move issues between columns based on status changes, Notifications for updates | Highly suitable for Kanban and Agile teams, allowing for continuous flow and quick adjustments. |
| **Bug Tracker**      | Open Bugs, In Progress, Resolved, Closed           | Auto-move issues to "Resolved" when closed, Notifications for new bug reports | Suitable for Agile teams focusing on iterative development and quick bug resolution.  |
| **Team Planning**    | Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done         | Auto-move tasks to "Review" when marked complete, Notifications for task assignments | Suitable for Agile teams, especially those using Scrum, as it allows for sprint planning and review stages. |
| **Roadmap**          | Upcoming Features, In Development, Released        | Auto-update status based on milestones, Notifications for feature updates | Suitable for Agile teams focusing on long-term planning and feature delivery, but may require additional customization for sprint cycles. |
| **Task List**        | To Do, In Progress, Completed                      | Auto-move tasks to "Completed" when marked done, Notifications for task updates | Suitable for Agile teams needing a simple task management system, but lacks advanced features for complex workflows. |

#### Chosen Template
I chose automated Kanban because it allows for easy tracking of tasks, and it is easier to auto-move issues from the starting stage to the completion stage.
