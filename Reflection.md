### Balancing Stakeholders' needs.
It was challenging to balance Stakeholders' needs because each stakeholder and their role in the system had to be taken into account. For instance, patients required a user-friendly system that reduced the steps in scheduling appointments and ensured that their data would be secured and well-protected. Doctors should be able to manage their schedules and their availability efficiently.

### Translating Requirements to Use Cases/Tests
Translating the functional and non-functional into use cases/tests was challenging because it required a long thinking process about each actor's role and the different actions they will have to undertake while using the system. Every step needed to be mentioned and explained.

### Reflection: Challenges in prioritization, estimation, or aligning Agile with stakeholder needs
As the only manager overseeing an Agile project, and I often find it difficult to prioritize tasks and estimate how much time each will take. Ensuring that the project aligns with user needs is also challenging. When I depend entirely on my own judgment, it can result in confusion and deadlines that aren't met. To improve, I should actively seek feedback and engage more with users to understand their needs. Additionally, staying flexible can help the project meet its objectives effectively.
