### Balancing Stakeholders' needs.
It was challenging to balance Stakeholders' needs because each stakeholder and their role in the system had to be considered. For instance, patients required a user-friendly system that reduced the steps in scheduling appointments and ensured that their data would be secured and well-protected. Doctors should be able to manage their schedules and their availability efficiently.

### Translating Requirements to Use Cases/Tests
Translating the functional and non-functional into use cases/tests was challenging because it required a long thinking process about each actor's role and the different actions they will have to undertake while using the system. Every step needed to be mentioned and explained.

### Reflection: Challenges in prioritization, estimation, or aligning Agile with stakeholder needs
As the only manager overseeing an Agile project, I often find it difficult to prioritize tasks and estimate how much time each will take. Ensuring that the project aligns with user needs is also challenging. When I depend entirely on my judgment, it can result in confusion and deadlines that aren't met. To improve, I should actively seek feedback and engage more with users to understand their needs. Additionally, staying flexible can help the project meet its objectives effectively.

### Reflection: Choosing and Editing GitHub Templates
When it comes to choosing a template on GitHub, it is a bit challenging as it doesn't offer a preview option or a demo to play around with, so that you can choose an option for your project without having to try different templates to choose the suitable one.
Customising the template can take a while, as you have to familiarise yourself with the workflow and have an idea of how to link the issues to the project. The other challenge is that once a template has been chosen, you can't go back and choose another one; you will have to create a new project and start from scratch.

### Reflection: Comparison between Github Templates, Trello and Jira

- **GitHub Templates**: They're easy to set up but offer limited customization. They are ideal for projects focused on software development. They work smoothly with GitHub repositories but don't offer a lot of reporting options.

- **Trello**: This tool is simple to use and can be customized. It's a good choice for small teams or personal projects. Trello supports connections to various tools, but doesn't have strong features for Agile project management.

- **Jira**: Jira is very customizable and suits complicated and big projects well. It offers a lot of support for Agile methods, detailed reporting, and is built to handle the needs of large enterprises.

### Reflection on Assignment 8

One of the main challenges when making UML diagrams, especially state and activity diagrams, is deciding how detailed they should be. If the diagrams have too much detail, they can become confusing and hard to understand, making it difficult for people to read them and increasing the mental effort needed. On the other hand, if there is too much generalization, important system behaviors or decision points might be missed. These are necessary for developing the system and checking if it works as expected. It's important to find the right balance. This means identifying the key transitions and actions that match what users need and grouping or simplifying less important processes that can be understood without details or found in other documents.

Another challenge is matching these diagrams with Agile user stories. User stories are often vague as they focus on business value and what the user wants, while diagrams need to show how the system works. For example, turning a user story like “As a patient, I want to book an appointment to see a doctor” into specific states like Requested, Confirmed, or Cancelled, or into steps like Choose Time and Confirm Slot, requires careful thought. Each diagram must be linked accurately to the user’s goal, making sure it doesn't go beyond what the story intends.

State diagrams and activity diagrams serve different, yet important roles. State diagrams show how an object behaves in response to events over time. They capture the lifecycle of things like appointments or notifications and are essential for systems that rely on status-driven logic. In contrast, activity diagrams illustrate workflows or processes. They show a sequence of tasks and decisions across various roles and are effective for highlighting business processes and user interactions. Together, they give a complete view—state diagrams show what can happen to objects over time, while activity diagrams detail how tasks are carried out.
