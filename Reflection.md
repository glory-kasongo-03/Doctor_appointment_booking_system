### Patient Needs
- **User-Friendliness**: Patients require an intuitive, easy-to-use interface that minimizes the steps to schedule appointments.
- **Appointment Availability**: Patients may struggle if the system doesn’t show real-time availability or has a long waitlist for appointments.
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensuring that personal and medical data is protected and compliant with regulations is critical.
- **Notifications**: Patients want timely reminders or notifications about upcoming appointments, changes, or cancellations.
- **Cancelation and Rescheduling**: Ensuring that patients have a straightforward way to cancel or reschedule without penalties, yet minimizing no-shows and late cancellations.
- **Wait Times**: Some patients might be frustrated by long wait times or delays due to doctor availability or system inefficiencies, which can lead to dissatisfaction.

### Doctor Needs
- **Time Management**: Doctors need to efficiently manage their schedules, ensuring the system doesn’t overbook or underutilize their time.
- **Customization**: Doctors may want control over their availability (e.g., blocking off time for lunch, personal time, or emergency appointments).
- **Data Access**: Doctors need easy access to patient histories, appointment details, and real-time updates to ensure smooth consultations.

### Administrative Needs (e.g., clinic staff)
- **Resource Management**: Admins need the system to help manage not just the doctor’s time but also resources like rooms or medical equipment.
- **Patient Flow**: Administrators may need insights into appointment volume, cancellations, and no-shows to better manage patient flow and ensure an efficient operation.
- **Data Management**: Admins need to track appointment history, patient records, and potentially handle billing/invoice generation.
