### Balancing Stakeholders' needs.
It was challenging to balance Stakeholders' needs because each stakeholder and their role in the system had to be taken into account. For instance, patients required a user-friendly system that reduced the steps in scheduling appointments and ensured that their data would be secured and well-protected. Doctors should be able to manage their schedules and their availability efficiently.

### Translating Requirements to Use Cases/Tests
Translating the functional and non-functional into use cases/tests was challenging because it required a long thinking process about each actor's role and the different actions they will have to undertake while using the system. Every step needed to be mentioned and explained.

### Reflection: Challenges in prioritization, estimation, or aligning Agile with stakeholder needs
As the only manager overseeing an Agile project, I often find it difficult to prioritize tasks and estimate how much time each will take. Ensuring that the project aligns with user needs is also challenging. When I depend entirely on my own judgment, it can result in confusion and deadlines that aren't met. To improve, I should actively seek feedback and engage more with users to understand their needs. Additionally, staying flexible can help the project meet its objectives effectively.

# Reflection: Choosing and Editing GitHub Templates
When it comes to choosing a template on GitHub, it is a bit challenging as it doesn't offer a preview option or a demo to play around with, so that you can choose an option for your project without having to try different templates to choose the suitable one.
It can take a while to customise the template, as you have to familiarise yourself with the workflow and have an idea of how to link the issues to the project. The other challenge is that once a template has been chosen, you can't go back and choose another template; you will have to create a new project and start from scratch.
