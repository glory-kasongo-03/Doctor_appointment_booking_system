### Balancing Stakeholders' needs.
It was challenging to balance Stakeholders' needs because each stakeholder and their role in the system had to be taken into account.

Doctors should be able to manage their schedules and their availability efficiently.

Translating the functional and non-functional into use cases/tests was challenging because it required a long thinking process about each actor's role and the different actions they will have to undertake while using the system. Every step needed to be mentioned and explained.
