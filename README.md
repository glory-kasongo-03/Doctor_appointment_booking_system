# ü©∫ Doctor Appointment Booking System

## üìã Project Description

A basic doctor appointment booking system ‚Äì a web and mobile-based application enabling patients to:

* Schedule medical appointments online
* Manage bookings
* Receive automated reminders

Doctors can manage their schedules, and hospital administrators can track statistics and optimize operations. A notification service is integrated for upcoming appointment reminders.

## üìê Justification for Repository Interface Design

* **Use of Generics**
  Abstracts common CRUD operations into `IRepository` to reduce duplication.

* **Entity-Specific Interfaces**
  Enables custom queries such as `find_by_email()` in `IPatientRepository`.

* **Adherence to SOLID Principles**

  * Interface Segregation: Interfaces tailored for each entity
  * Dependency Inversion: Components depend on abstractions

* **Testability and Flexibility**
  Improves unit testing and service mocking via dependency injection.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Dependency Injection vs Factory Pattern

### ‚úÖ Why Dependency Injection?

* **Highly Testable** ‚Äì Easy mock injection
* **Separation of Concerns** ‚Äì Abstraction-driven design
* **Flexible** ‚Äì Supports multiple implementations (e.g., DB, cache)
* **Framework Friendly** ‚Äì Integrates well with FastAPI, Django, Flask

### ‚ùó Factory Pattern Trade-offs

* **Good For** ‚Äì Dynamic object creation
* **Downsides** ‚Äì Obscured dependencies, tighter coupling, harder to test

## üß± Design Pattern Justifications

| Pattern          | Use Case                                   | Justification                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Simple Factory   | Create user roles (Patient, Doctor, Admin) | Centralized logic, easier role management     |
| Factory Method   | Sending notifications (Email, SMS)         | Flexibility to extend new channels            |
| Abstract Factory | Render platform-specific UI (Web/Mobile)   | Consistent UI components per platform         |
| Builder          | Constructing complex Appointment objects   | Step-by-step clarity and flexibility          |
| Prototype        | Duplicate report templates                 | Efficient cloning, saves performance          |
| Singleton        | Maintain a single database connection      | Avoids conflicts and excessive resource usage |
