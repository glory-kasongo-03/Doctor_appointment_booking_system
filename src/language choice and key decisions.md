## Language Choice & Key Decisions

### Why Python?

Python was chosen as the implementation language for the **Doctor Appointment Booking System** due to the following reasons:

- **Readability:**  
    Python’s clean syntax is ideal for modelling complex workflows like user registration, appointment handling, and medical record updates. It makes the system easier to understand and modify — perfect for academic use and collaborative development.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Support:**  
    The system is inherently object-oriented, with entities like `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`, and `EHR` — making Python a natural fit for modeling these real-world components using classes and inheritance.

- **Dynamic Typing + Type Hints:**  
    Python’s support for type hints (e.g., `str`, `List`, `DateTime`) helps document method signatures and improves code quality with IDE support and static checks, which is especially useful for managing healthcare-related data structures.

- **Flexibility for Extensions:**  
    This booking system could easily be integrated with **Flask** or **Django** to expose REST APIs, send email/SMS notifications, or connect to a PostgreSQL database — making Python a future-ready choice for full-stack deployment.

### Design Choices

#### Encapsulation

- Sensitive fields like `_password`, `_medicalHistory`, and `_diagnosis` are marked private using a leading underscore.
- Getter/setter methods (via Python’s `@property`) control access — particularly useful for fields related to **user credentials** and **electronic health records (EHRs)**.

#### Inheritance

- `Patient` and `Doctor` both inherit from `UserAccount`, as they share common actions like `login()`, `logout()`, and `changePassword()`.
- This supports **role-based behavior** while minimizing code duplication — doctors have specialized methods like `approveAppointment()`, while patients can `bookAppointment()`.

#### Relationships

- **Association:**
    - A `Patient` can book multiple `Appointments` and view their `EHR` records.
    - A `Doctor` can manage multiple `Appointments` and update `EHR`s — modelled through **list attributes** that hold object references.

- **Composition:**
    - Each `SystemReport` (e.g., usage analytics, audit logs) is **generated by a `UserAccount`**. If the user is removed, the context of the report is lost — reflecting a **tight coupling**.

- **Aggregation:**
    - `Notification` instances are associated with `UserAccount` and `Appointment` but aren’t strongly owned. A notification can exist independently (e.g., system-wide reminders), showing **looser coupling** and **shared ownership**.

### Summary

By using Python and applying OOP best practices, the **Doctor Appointment Booking System** achieves:

- Clear mapping of domain concepts (Doctors, Patients, EHRs)
- Reusability through inheritance
- Safe data handling through encapsulation
- Realistic modelling of system relationships (composition vs aggregation)

These choices ensure the system is:

- Scalable for real-world extensions (e.g., prescription management)
- Maintainable for future developers
- Modular for testing and deployment
