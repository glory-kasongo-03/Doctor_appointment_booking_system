### Kanban Board Overview  

A **Kanban board** is a simple visual tool used to manage tasks by showing them in different stages. It helps teams stay organized and efficient. The board is set up with **columns** and **cards**:  
- **Columns** indicate a stage in the task process, such as **" To Do," "In Progress," "Review,"** and **"Done."**  
- **Cards** represent individual tasks and move through these columns as work progresses.  

### **How a Kanban Board Works**  

#### **Visualizing Workflow**  

The board's **columns** show different stages: **"To Do," "In Progress," "Review,"** and **"Done."** Each task is a **card** that moves from one column to the next as work progresses. This setup allows teams to quickly see where each task is, making it easy to spot areas that need more attention.  

#### **Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)**  

To prevent teams from taking on too much at once, **WIP limits** are used. These limits control the number of tasks allowed in each column. This rule ensures that work is **completed before new tasks start**.  

For example, if the **"In Progress"** column can have only three tasks, no new ones can be added until one is completed. This approach prevents bottlenecks and keeps the team focused.  

#### **Supporting Agile Principles**  

- **Continuous Delivery:** Tasks are finished and delivered as soon as they are ready, without waiting for a specific release date.  
- **Adaptability:** Teams can adjust priorities by adding, removing, or moving tasks without disrupting the workflow.  
- **Incremental Improvements:** Regular reviews of the board help teams improve workflows, remove inefficiencies, and streamline processes over time.
